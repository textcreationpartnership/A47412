            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Need not tell you the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Meeting; The ſad Object lying before your Ey declares that. And though <hi>He who is gone</hi> be principally concerned in drawing you to this <hi>Houſe of Mourning,</hi> yet muſt ye not repute your ſelves wholly unconcern'd,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50428:4"/>The benefit will redound to you, who
<note place="margin">

            <p>I read of one <hi>Philoromus Galata</hi> who was ſo much in love with Death, he liv'd ſome years in a Tomb to prepare Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for it</p>
            <p>This Spectacle, and this Diſcourſe tends to this Preparation; So that I hope ye will not repent an hours ſtay here with me.</p>
            <p>The Grave is commonly as powerful an Oratour as the Pulpit, and by preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fears of an III Death inſtructs us in the Rules of a Good Life: My aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is that as the winding Sheet fits eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body by dilating or contracting it ſelf to each ones ſize, ſo my diſcourſe will ſuit it ſelf to every Hearer. Like <hi>Philipp</hi>'s Boy, it holds out to Youth a Skull, to Age, a Coffin.</p>
            <p>Who next amongſt us is likely to fall into this low Centre may be doubtfull; 'Tis ſure at one time or other we all muſt: And probably we ſhall not all of us a few dayes hence meet here again.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50428:4"/>
            <p>Therefore whereſoever that final Lot may chance to fall, whether on ſome Hearer, or on the Speaker, You will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Text a pious remembrancer to Thoſe who ſtay behind, and an antidated valediction to thoſe who next go hence. So then as St. <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Corinthians; Whether it be I or You, ſo I Preach,
<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15 11.</note> and ſo Yee juſtly muſt believe,</hi> That happy ſhall their condition be in the Next world, who after a Religious life dye well in This.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the Death of His Saints.</hi>
            </p>

<note place="margin">1. Patt. Death.</note> with <hi>Death;</hi> The full Period and Cloſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A Subject better defin'd by ſilence,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50428:5"/>than ſpeech, and ſounds more patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally from a Tomb than a Pulpit. The Arguments of this place are (or ſhould be God and His VVorks, But amidſt the whole Catalogue of thoſe works of His we find not <hi>Death:</hi> A thing of ſo unbleſt a Being It cannot derive it ſelf from His Hand and Facture who made All other things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Light</hi> was his Creature, Strook out and Kindled by His <hi>Fiat Lux,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3.</note> Let there be Light:</hi> And Life was inſpired by His Powerful Breath who breathed <hi>Spiracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum vitae</hi> into Man.
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7.</note> But Darkneſs and Death are Children of other Parentage. God made no Privations to Smother His Works, No Extinguiſhers of Light or Nature; No Sickneſs to ſupplant Health, nor Infirmity to diſſolve Strength;
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>VViſ.</hi> 1.14</note> 
               <hi>The Generations of the World were healthful, and there was no Poiſon of deſtruction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</hi> Darkneſs is but a defect of Light, and Death a Privation of Life, therefore none of His,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 13</note> 
               <hi>For God hath not made Death, neither hath He pleaſure in the deſtruction of the living.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50428:6"/>
            <p>If you would have <hi>Death's</hi> Pedigree, ſearch not in God's Book of Creatures, amongſt the Records of Life, but ſee the Annals of Sin. That and Sin were Twins nurſed up together, engendred of two accurſed Parents, the Serpent's Active Malice, and Man's Diſobedience. From hence do we derive this Monſter, This Enemy to Nature, and Oppoſite to God: For ſo it is.</p>
            <p>This demoliſheth what He Builds, The goodly frame of Mankind is by Death ruined and layd in Farth; This Reverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what He enacted, Marrs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makes all that He made before.</p>
            <p>You ſee at what Breach <hi>Death</hi> enter'd, The breach of God's Covenant. There the Inundation ran in, whoſe furious tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent will not be ſtopp'd until it hath overwhelm'd and cover'd the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Adam</hi> did this Tyrant begin his dangerous Reign: On his Fall was Death's Throne crected; his Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the firſt Stair of the Aſcent, ſince which time he hath ſtill raiſed that fatal Mound by heaping on it all the Bodies of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50428:6"/>his Children, <hi>For in Adam we all dye;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.</note> His Fall maim'd and Creepled Poſterity, which hath ever ſince complained of that bruiſe; The Earth yet groans under the barren Curſe thrown upon it for <hi>Adam's</hi> ſake;

            </p>
            <p>Thus as <hi>Aſhur</hi> was the <hi>Rod of Gods vengeance</hi> to ſcourge the rebellious Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
<note place="margin">

            <p>Here then you ſee, though <hi>Death</hi> were none of God's works, Yet is it over All His works: This Thing of No being, this Privation, this Nothing, devours All things; For what is free from this Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene? what Plant doth not this Worm ſtrike? what Elementary Body Animate or Inanimate is not ſubject to Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Templa, Saxa, Marmora,

            <p>I cannot but remember at this Time was a Twelvemonth in the Higheſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrity which our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court can Boaſt, the <hi>Solemn Feaſt of St. George held at Windſor,</hi> His Infirmity Forced Him, by Particular Licence and Approbation of His Soveraign, to Depute me unto <hi>That Office,</hi> which in <hi>That place</hi> properly belong'd to Him.</p>
            <p>I little thought that in a Mournfull Solemnity where Himſelf became the Subject, I ſhould the following Year, and the very next Day after that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, be Deputed to this Laſt Service at His Grave.</p>
            <p>But thus You ſee how Joyes and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows by courſe exerciſe their ſeveral Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions over us, And how the Greateſt Triumph Earth affords is attended at the

            </p>
            <p>That I heartily Lov'd, and from the converſe of many younger years Valued the Owner of that Dead Relick lying before me, is a real Truth: For that cauſe Ye therefore muſt not expect any large Panegyricks from me, leſt happily Yee might think He needed them.</p>
            <p>Though Praiſe be a fit Gloſs ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Deſert, there is danger, at leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion in the exceſs: As unskilfull Painters by laying on too much Varniſh dead the Colours and marr the Piece they would ſet off. Indeed in any Mournfull Arguments, Invention is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly moſt free, where with leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Concern it looks upon the Object. Paſſion or Affection mingling with them, render it too ſerious for any Rhetorick but Sorrow. This I profeſs to be my Caſe; And if it would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray more of the weaker Sex than is fit for me to own, I could make good the words of St. <hi>Augustine, Potius libet flere quàm aliquid dicere,</hi> My Eyes could eaſily prove more fluent than my Tongue.</p>

            <p>Yet leſt Ye fail of all Ye look for, As the Evening Sun immediately before his Set Unites, and in ſome ſhort flaſhes caſts forth his Beams before he bury them in that Cloud wherein he Sets, I will briefly ſumm up the Paſſages of His Life even from his Youth, which was His Sun-riſe, unto the Declination of His Age, which brought Him to this Bed of Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>He was Born of Worthy and Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parents.</p>
            <p>His Education was in This Famous School, In This very College where He was admitted a Kings Scholar of that Noble Foundation, which hath ſent out ſo many excellent Proficients in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to each Univerſity. For Both thoſe Fair Rivers doth this Spring by contributing ſome Supplies to Them annually feed.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>He</hi> had the greateſt Dignity which the School could afford put upon Him, to be the <hi>Paedonomus at Chriſtmas, Lord of His Fellow-Scholars:</hi> Which Title was a pledge and preſage that

            <p>From Hence He was tranſlated by Election to Chriſts-Church in <hi>Oxford:</hi> where having run through ſome Offices in the College conferr'd both as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Trials upon the beſt Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, He was remov'd to <hi>All-ſouls;</hi> and when His Degree and Time made Him capable of Publick Employment, Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen <hi>Proctour</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity.</hi>

            <p>After the taking His Degree of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, in ſome few years He was by His Royal Maſter (whoſe Chaplain He had been) made Dean of <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> ſo becoming Head of that College into which He was firſt admitted Student.</p>
            <p>The more Publick Office of <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chancellour</hi> was then caſt upon Him by that <hi>Martyr'd Archbiſhop,</hi> who well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Univerſities advantage from ſo deſerving a Subſtitute.</p>
            <p>Theſe Offices he ſupply'd with ſuch Ability and Integrity, That His Graci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cious Maſter thought Him worthy to receive the Greateſt Truſt He poſſibly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50428:21"/>Could plant in Him, To be the Tutour and Educator of our Soveraign in His Minority, together with His Princely Brother.</p>
            <p>This Truſt brought on Him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a Biſhoprick for His Reward, firſt <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> then <hi>Salisbury.</hi> Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lifted up Two Aſcents by the bounty of His Old Maſter, He was eaſily raiſed to the Third by His Preſent Soveraign, The Biſhoprick of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in which He became <hi>Ex Officio Prelate of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> That Honour being alwayes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to This Office He ſo well Became, That None before Him Did, nor Any who follow can Better. For He was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way Qualified, both in the Comelineſs of His Perſon, and the Gracefulneſs of His Deportment, and the Excellency of His Parts: All which Capacities ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Him worthy the ſervice of a Court, and every way <hi>fit to ſtand before Princes.</hi>

            <p>He had this happineſs, That from the very Firſt Relation to thoſe Tender years of His Gracious Soveraign du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50428:21"/>His Care and Tuition of Him, He held the ſame Degree and Station in His Favour, which never abated in the leaſt meaſure, but continued to His Death.</p>
            <p>And as He was ever acceptable to the Preſence of His Maſter whilſt able to make His approaches to the Court: So when Infirmity (which confin'd Him to His Chamber) render'd Him fit onely to be viſited, He wanted not thoſe Royal Viſits made to Him by His Lord. Who though He could not ſay, as Chriſt to the Centurion imploring His Goodneſs to His ſick ſervant, <hi>Ego veniens ſanabo, I will come in preſence to perform His Cure;</hi> Yet He perform'd the Firſt part, <hi>Ego veniens, He came,</hi> not ſeldome neither, both to ſee Him in His weakneſs, and to comfort Him amidſt His Pains.</p>
            <p>I muſt not omit to tell you, As once the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to ſee the Dying Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.14.</note> that he might take his Farewell, and with that Farewell a Bleſſing from One he never ſhould ſee again: So did a Better King than He,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50428:22"/>the <hi>King of our Iſrael,</hi> repair to This dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prelate a few hours before His Expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not onely to <hi>See,</hi> but to require a <hi>Benediction</hi> from Him at Parting; which in the loweſt Poſture of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity He beſought. And let me tell you (not to Flatter Him) amongſt His other Virtues, never was there a more affable Sweetneſs, or leſs Pride in ſo great a Prince. Both which He fairly expreſſed, when Kneeling down at the Bed-ſide He begg'd His laſt Bleſſing, which He like <hi>Jacob</hi> on His Death-bed (and now <hi>as Dim-ſighted as Jacob</hi>) with one Hand laid upon His Maſters Head,
<note place="margin">

            <p>I have very little more to ſay, Onely tell you in addition to His former Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, He was dignified with the <hi>Office of High Almoner,</hi> being intruſted with the beſtowing His <hi>Majesties Charity;</hi> which like a faithful Steward He ſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpenſed, That in evidence of His Integrity He Copy'd out that Office in his own Practice; Not only in His Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies to Chriſt-Church in <hi>Oxford</hi> and to <hi>Alſoules,</hi> to the Churches of <hi>Salisbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> of <hi>Chichester,</hi> and <hi>Winchester,</hi> But to a Famous Almehouſe erected at His pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar charge in <hi>Richmond,</hi> the place of His retirement, whch ſtands a Conſpicuous Monument and Memorial of Him whilſt the World laſts. 'Tis well when our Good deeds follow us, but much better when they goe before. In works of Charity perform'd whilſt we live here
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50428:23"/>we are God's immediate Almoners, what is done when we are Gone is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Our Executors than Ours. They are happy who by any hand beſtow their Almes, but it is more honour and better ſarisfaction when Our Charity needs no Executor but the Doners Hand to diſpenſe, nor overſeer but His own Eye.</p>
            <p>From His Charity you will eaſily Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate His other Virtues. His Bounty was alwaies eminent according to His ability; And when He came to be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a large and full Fortune He ſo well practis'd St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Leſſon,

            <p>His Diſpoſition was moſt free &amp; open, His Heart without cloſe Angles or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
